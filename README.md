Welcome to CHANCE (CHiP-seq ANalytics and Confidence Estimation)!
=================
The core algorithm of CHANCE has been re-implemented in [deepTools](https://deeptools.github.io) (bamFingerprint). The underlying normalization framework has been implemented in the differential peak caller [THOR](http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/08/01/nar.gkw680.full). We recommend these tools.

=========
11/30/12-TAIR10 support is in beta, note that ENCODE doesn't have Aribidopsis data atm so functionionality requiring ENCODE is disabled.
