USAGE SUMMARY:

run_chance.sh /PATH/TO/MCR batch -p parameter_file -o output_file (-b on/off)

Notes: 1. parameter_file and output_file should be the full paths to the respective files.
       2. The -b parameter is optional, it toggles batch effects detection, the default is "on".
       3. There is also an auxillary sub-routine to bin reads which can be accessed directly. 
       The invocation is : run_chance.sh /PATH/TO/MCR batch binData -p parameter_file
       This can be useful if you plan to run CHANCE multiple times on the same files, since
       the binned reads take much less memory and time to read. Also, the binary format (.mat)
       that this routine produces can be read by the GUI version of CHANCE. The parameter file
       format for this subroutine is: alignments_file_name,output_file_name,sample_id,build,file_type  
*********************************************************
PARAMETER FILE FORMAT:

The parameter file are comma separated values with no headers. Place one line per file to process. Each line must have the following format:

IP_file_name,Input_file_name,IP_sample_ID,Input_sample_ID,Build,File_type

IP_file_name : the full path to the IP sample
Input_file_name : the full path to the Input sample
IP_sample_ID : any string, will identify the IP sample in the CHANCE output file
Input_sample_ID : any string, will identify the Input sample in the CHANCE output file
Build : hg18, hg19, mm9 or tair10
File_type : a string indicating the type of file storing the alignments, one of: "bam", "sam", "bowtie", "bed", "tagAlign", or "mat". BAM file format is fastest aside from MAT, which is the matlab format for samples saved from a CHANCE gui session or a call to binData

*********************************************************
CHANCE OUTPUT FILE FORMAT:

CHANCE outputs two files output_file and output_file.msg.
output_file is a tab separated values file with the following fields:

IP : the ID string of the IP sample
Input : the ID string of the Input sample
test : sample classification string, one of:
     PASS - the sample shows significant signal at an FDR <= 5%
     WEAK - the sample shows significant signal at 5% < FDR <=10%
     FAIL - the sample does NOT show significant signal, FDR > 10%
p-value : the p-value for the divergence test used to classify sample
	(you might want to threshold this value yourself instead of using
	FDRs computed by CHANCE)
FDR : this is a q-value (positive FDR) defined as the minimum q-value (Fisher's method)
    computed over any of the following 5 subsets of ENCODE training data
IP_strength : percentage enrichment of IP over Input, as a fraction from 0 to 1
	    This and Percent_genome_enriched are essentially the test statistics
	    which are implicitly used to determine the p-value and subsequently
	    the FDR.
Percent_genome_enriched : percentage of the genome differentially enriched
FDR_cancer_tfbs : FDR for transcription factor binding site ChIPs in cancer cells
FDR_cancer_histone : FDR for epigenetic mark ChIPs in cancer cells
FDR_cancer_tfbs : FDR for transcription factor binding site ChIPs in normal cells
FDR_cancer_tfbs : FDR for epigenetic mark ChIPs in normal cells
FDR_cancer_tfbs : FDR for the combined dataset
Input_bias : a test statistic measuring bias in the sample, when this metric is high the
	   ChIP may have worked but the sample will have low statistical power due
	   to bias in the library preparation. This tests for bi-modality in the frequency-
	   response of the Input channel read-density. Bi-modality indicates systematic
	   bias in read-density which can be introduced for example by some chromatin
	   sonnication methods.
Input_bias_pvalue : a p-value for the Input_bias test statistic, when this is low there is
		  a significant bias in the Input channel 
batch : An integer from 1 to the number of samples. If the same index is repeated then there 
      may be batch-effects and the samples with the same index may have come from the same batch.
      This routine only checks for batch-effects in the Input channel.
      
output_file.msg is a descriptive file with one entry per sample. Each entry contains error messages and warnings regarding the sample, scaling factors, and other descriptive metrics such as indicators of zero-inflation in the IP or Input channels or very high duplication levels indicating possible PCR bias. If you see a failed sample in the TSV file you might want to check that sample's entry in this file for more information.
