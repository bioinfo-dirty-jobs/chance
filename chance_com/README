USAGE SUMMARY:

run_chance.sh /PATH/TO/MCR batch -p parameter_file -o output_file

Note: parameter_file and output_file should be the full paths to the respective files.

*********************************************************
PARAMETER FILE FORMAT:

The parameter file are comma separated values with no headers. Place one line per file to process. Each line must have the following format:

IP_file_name,Input_file_name,IP_sample_ID,Input_sample_ID,TF_name,Build,File_type

IP_file_name : the full path to the IP sample
Input_file_name : the full path to the Input sample
IP_sample_ID : any string, will identify the IP sample in the CHANCE output file
Input_sample_ID : any string, will identify the Input sample in the CHANCE output file
TF_name : a string identifying the transcription factor or epigenetic mark ChIP'ed for
Build: a string indicating the organism, either "hg19" or "mm9"
File_type : a string indicating the type of file storing the alignments, one of: "bam", "sam", "bowtie", "bed", "tagAlign", or "mat". BAM file format is fastest aside from MAT, which is the matlab format for samples saved from a CHANCE gui session.

*********************************************************
CHANCE OUTPUT FILE FORMAT:

CHANCE outputs two files output_file and output_file.msg. 
output_file is a tab separated values file with the following fields:

IP : the ID string of the IP sample
Input : the ID string of the Input sample
test : sample classification string, one of:
     PASS - the sample shows significant signal at an FDR <= 5%
     WEAK - the sample shows significant signal at 5% < FDR <=10%
     FAIL - the sample does NOT show significant signal, FDR > 10%
p-value : the p-value for the divergence test used to classify sample
	(you might want to threshold this value yourself instead of using
	FDRs computed by CHANCE)
FDR : this is a q-value (positive FDR) defined as the minimum q-value (Fisher's method)
    computed over any of the following 5 subsets of ENCODE training data
FDR_cancer_tfbs : FDR for transcription factor binding site ChIPs in cancer cells
FDR_cancer_histone : FDR for epigenetic mark ChIPs in cancer cells
FDR_cancer_tfbs : FDR for transcription factor binding site ChIPs in normal cells
FDR_cancer_tfbs : FDR for epigenetic mark ChIPs in normal cells
FDR_cancer_tfbs : FDR for the combined dataset
Input_bias : a test statistic measuring bias in the sample, when this metric is high the
	   ChIP may have worked but the sample will have low statistical power due
	   to bias in the library preparation.
Input_bias_pvalue : a p-value for the Input_bias test statistic 

output_file.msg is a descriptive file with one entry per sample. Each entry contains error messages and warnings regarding the sample, scaling factors, and other descriptive metrics.
