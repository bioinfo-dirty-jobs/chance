Installation instructions:

Mac OS X:
    -Decompress the CHANCE archive
      *Unzip the file chance_macos.zip by double clicking the chance_macos.zip icon
      *Open the folder chance_macos, in the same location as the zip file
    -Install MCR, the MATLAB Compiler Runtime:
      *Unzip MCRInstaller.zip by double clicking its icon
      *Double click InstallForMacOSX
      *Follow the on screen instructions, keep track of the install location if you change the default
    -To start CHANCE:  
      *Double click the chance icon
      *To start CHANCE from the command line:
      	  #Navigate to the chance_macos folder
	  #Execute ./run_chance.sh path_to_mcr, where path_to_mcr is the path to the MCR you installed
	  	   		   		the default is /Applications/MATLAB/MATLAB_Compiler_Runtime/v717/
    -NOTES: You can move/copy the chance icon (chance.app) to the /Applications folder or any other location if you like.
    	    If you want to start chance from the command line the run_chance.sh needs to be in the same folder as chance.app.
	    The first time you start CHANCE it will take a little longer than usual to start since CHANCE needs to configure the MCR.
