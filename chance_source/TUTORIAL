This tutorial is a walkthrough of how to use CHANCE's features. It refers to the files in the sample_data/
folder available from http://songlab.ucsf.edu/CHANCE. For complete documentation see: https://github.com/songlab/chance/wiki 

1. Creating a sample from a data file containing mapped reads:
   -Click the "Create Sample" button in the middle of the CHANCE window.
   -Navigate to the sample_data/ folder
   -Select wgEncodeBroadHistoneH1hescH3k4me1StdAlnRep1.bam and click Open
     (This file contains H3K4me3 ChIP-seq in HESC, reads mapped to HG19, from Broad via ENCODE.)
   -When prompted enter the type of the file to be read (bam) and the build (hg19)
   -When prompted enter a name for the sample.
2. Deleting samples:
   -Select the sample ID from the "Samples" window.
   -Click "Delete Sample"
3. Restoring samples from a previous session: 
   -Click the "Restore saved samples" button
   -Navigate to the sample_data/ directory
   -Select broad_data.mat and click open
    (This contains H3K4me1,2,3, H3K36me3, H3K27me3, and Input samples in HESC, from Broad via ENCODE.)
4. Saving working samples to file:
   (Restoring saved samples is faster than creating samples from files containing reads, so 
    saving your working samples to file is recommended.)
   -Click "Save samples to file"
   -Navigate to the desired directory and enter a file name.
   -Click save
5. View IP strength:
   -Select an IP sample (H1 HESC Broad H3K4me3 IP) in the "Samples:" window.
   -Click the "View IP strength" button.
   -Select a matching Input sample (H1 HESC Broad Input) in the drop down dialog box.
   -CHANCE will now spawn 3 windows: a summary statement, an enrichment plot, and a second linearization plot
    (see the documentation for interpretations of these plots, see 10. below for working with plot windows)
6. Compare with ENCODE:
   -Select an IP sample (H1 HESC Broad H3K4me3 IP) in the "Samples:" window.
   -Click the "Compare with ENCODE" button.
   -Select a matching Input sample (H1 HESC Broad Input) in the drop down dialog box.
   -Select the transcription factor or epigenetic mark type from the drop down dialog box.
   -CHANCE will now spawn a plot window: 
    (see the documentation for interpretations of this plot, see 10. below for working with plot windows)
7. Multi IP normalization:
   -Click the "Multi IP normalization" button.
   -Enter the number of experiments to compare in the dialog box.
   -Select, one by one, the experiments to include in the drop down dialog box.
   -CHANCE will now spawn 3 windows: a summary statement, a differential enrichment comparison matrix,
    and an enrichment plot.
    (see the documentation for interpretations of these plots, see 10. below for working with plot windows)
8. Validate candidate regions:
   -Select an IP sample (H1 HESC Broad H3K4me3 IP) in the "Samples:" window.
   -Click the "Validate region list" button.
   -Select a matching Input sample (H1 HESC Broad Input) in the drop down dialog box.
   -Select a file containing the regions to be validated. (sample_data/gene_promoter_list.txt)
    The file must be a plain text file with one region per line. Each line must be tab separated of the form:
    chrom     start	 stop	   ID
    Where chrom is a chromosome identifier matching one of the chomosome identifiers in
    the original file of reads from which the sample was generated, for example: chr1 or chrY.
    start and stop are integers giving the genomic coordinates where the defined region
    starts and stops. ID is any user string which will identify the sample 
   -CHANCE will now spawn a plot window: 
    (see the documentation for interpretations of this plot, see 10. below for working with plot windows)
9. View nucleotide frequency:
   -Select a sample (H1 HESC Broad H3K4me3 IP) in the "Samples:" window.
   -Click the "View nucleotide frequency" button.
   -CHANCE will now spawn a 3 plot windows: the frequencies of A,C,G,T, and the frequencies of uncallable bases 
    (see the documentation for interpretations of these plots, see 10. below for working with plot windows)
10. Working with plot windows:
   CHACE plots come with a vaiety of plot tools:
   -Save: save a plot for the first time by clicking on the disk icon. Subsequent saves can be done using 
          the "Save" or "Save As" commands on the file menu. Plots can be saved as pdf, jpg, png, eps and 
	  several other common formats.
   -Print: click the print icon or use the "Print" command in the file menu.
   -Zoom/Pan: the magifying glass icons allow you to zoom in and out of the plot while the hand icon allows you to pan.
   -Data curser: a data curser can be added to inspect particular values in the plot via the data curser icon
11. View Phred score data:
   -Select a sample (H1 HESC Broad H3K4me3 IP) in the "Samples:" window.
   -Click the "View Phred score map" button.
   -CHANCE will now spawn a plot window:
    (see the documentation for interpretations of this plot, see 10. below for working with plot windows)
12. View read density bias:
   -Select a sample (H1 HESC Broad H3K4me3 IP) in the "Samples:" window.
   -Click the "View read density bias" button.
   -CHANCE will now spawn a plot window:
    (see the documentation for interpretations of this plot, see 10. below for working with plot windows)
13. Export a log of the session:
   -Click on the "Export main output to text file" button above the "Main Output" window.
